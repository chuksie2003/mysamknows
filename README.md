data point anomaly
============================================================================================
Use of Outlier Algorithim to define data point anomalies in Samknows dataset
============================================================================================
Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations on data , they may indicate a variability in a measurement
, experimental errors or a novelty. In other words, an outlier is an observation that diverges from an overall pattern on a sample.
The algorithm utilizes the data point thresholding to identfy anomalies in data

The TSQL code leverages existing algorithm investigate data sets and identify anomalies.
